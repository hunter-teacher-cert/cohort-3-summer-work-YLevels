Exercise 1

1. Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. 

//The program loop will start with n = 10.

i      n
10     10
5      10
6      10
3      10
4      10
2      10
1      10

2. The output of this program is:
10
5
6
3
4
2

3. Since i = n and the loop terminates when i = 1, the loop should terminate when n = 1.
