Exercise 1

if (x > 0 && x <10) {
System.out.println("positive single digit number.");
}

Exercise 2

main - creates integer named bizz (worth 5) and integer named buzz (worth 2). 
zoop - program shows "just for"
since bizz = 5 that means bob = 5 it will go to ping
ping - program shows "any not more"

then go back to main and finish with clink
clink - the expression evaluates to 4
program shows "It's "
then go to zoop
zoop - program shows "breakfast"
next line - program shows "!"

The complete output is:
just for
any not more
It's breakfast
!

Exercise 3

Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program in Section 5.8 after main invokes nLines with the parameter n==4, just before the last invocation of nLines returns.

main - ()
nLines - (creates four blank lines)
