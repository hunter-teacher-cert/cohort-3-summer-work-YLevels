Exercise 1

1. The output of the program is:

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

2. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

main = line 1 -> "No, I "
       continue with zoop
zoop = refer to baffle
baffle = line 1 -> "wug"
       continue with ping
ping = end line with "."

//whatever comes after ping starts a new line

Figure 2.1: Stack diagram for ping.

3. If you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method you will get caught in a loop between baffle and ping causing an error.
